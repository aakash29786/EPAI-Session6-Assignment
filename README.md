EPAi5 Session 6

The session 6 of the EPAI course was an adventurous ride that took us on a tour of Closure functions and Decorators. The concept explained in the class were amazing and proper usage of these functions makes the Python code look so elegant. To followup on the learnings, the session 6 assignment was all about writing a closure and decorator fucntion that could take in other functions and perform the given operations on them. As a departure from prevous assignments, we had to also write our own tests this time. 

I will mention the functions below:

# Function 1
check_docstring : The very first function is the check_docstring function that checks if the function that is being passed to it has greater than 50 characters in its docstring or not. This docstring is a closure function and has the number 50 stored as a free variable. The function has enough checks and balances to filter out unwanted arguments cases such as the function passed is not an integer, complex number or a string

# Function 2
fibonacci : The second function is the fibonacci function which is also a closure function that takes a number and gets the fibonacci of that number. The function has enough checks and balances to filter out unwanted arguments cases such as the number passed is not an negative integer, complex number or a string

# Function 3
counter : The third function is the counter function which is used as a decorator function that = that maintains and updates a global dictionary variable depending on the number of times a function (add /div/ mul) is called. The function has enough checks and balances to filter out unwanted arguments cases such as the function passed is not an negative integer, complex number or a string

# Function 4 
add : A simple add function that is used to test the counter decorator function

# Function 5
mul : A simple mul function that is used to test the counter decorator function

# Function 6
div : A simple div function that is used to test the counter decorator function
